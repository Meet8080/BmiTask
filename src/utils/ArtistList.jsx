        I'll touch that fire for you
        I do that three four times again, I testify for you
        I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
        I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
        Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
        Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
        Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
        I don't got nobody, just with you right now
        Tell the truth, I look better under you
        
        I can't lose when I'm with you
        How can I snooze and miss the moment?
        You just too important
        Nobody do body like you do
        I can't lose when I'm with you
        I can't just snooze and miss the moment

    lyrics: `You say, "I don't understand," and I say, "I know you don't"
        We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
        Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
        Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
        
        Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
        I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
        Always risin' from the ashes
        Mendin' all her gashes
        You might just have dealt the final blow
        
        Stop, you're losin' me
        Stop, you're losin' me
        Stop, you're losin' me
        I can't find a pulse
        My heart won't start anymore
        For you
        'Cause you're losin' me
        
        Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
        How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
        I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
        My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick`,

    lyrics: `Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
        But I'm only going to get this one chance
        Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
        Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
        If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
        And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
        You were just what the doctor ordered
        
        I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
        All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
        Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
        They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
        
        But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
        I got a laptop in my back pocket
        My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
        Got a fat knot from that rap profit
        Made a living and a killing off it
        Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
        With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
        I'm an MC still as honest
        But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
        This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
        You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
        Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac

    lyrics: `Streets are crowded, but we're in our zone,
    Hearts beating together, making us feel at home.
    With every step, a story unfolds,
    In the city of dreams, where tales are told.
    
    And the air is thick with loss and indecision
        I know my pain is such an imposition
        Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
        And you know what they all say
        You don't know what you got until it's gone
        
        Stop, you're losin' me
        Stop, you're losin' me
        Stop, you're losin' me
        I can't find a pulse
        My heart won't start anymore
        For you
        'Cause you're losin' me
        'Cause you're losin' me
        Stop (stop) 'cause you're losin' me
        
        My heart won't start anymore ('cause you're losin' me)
        My heart won't start anymore ('cause you're losin' me)
        
        How long could we be a sad song
        'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
        I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
        And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
        Fighting in only your army
        Frontlines, don't you ignore me
        I'm the best thing at this party
        (You're losin' me)
        And I wouldn't marry me either
        A pathological people pleaser
        Who only wanted you to see her
        And I'm fadin', thinkin'

    In the city where the lights shine bright,
Underneath the neon, we dance all night.
Lost in the rhythm, we're chasing dreams,
In a world where nothing's quite as it seems.

        I know my pain is such an imposition
